## Manual Installation

1. Download Zip.
2. Drag ThiccCoilHead.bundle and ThiccCoilHead.dll into the Plugins folder in BepInEx.

## Compatibility

 * [CoilHeadStare](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TwinDimensionalProductions/CoilHeadStare/)
 * Audio Replacment Mods

## Known Issues


 * Can still see a part of the creature and they move. ( This is because the new model has not changed the original collider boxes so the game treats them the same size as vanilla coil heads)


## Credits

* Massive credit to [TwinDimensionalProductions](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/TwinDimensionalProductions/) as while working together to try and make our mods compatible he also improved my code a lot 
* [onioogama](https://www.instagram.com/onioogama/) As the original talented concept artist. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Art_Doragoon) | [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/bangboodoragon) 
* [OrtonLongGaming](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/OrtonLongGaming/) As much of the original code was based on his [ FNaFEndoCoilhead](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/OrtonLongGaming/FNaFEndoCoilhead/)  mod. As well as his guidance as I was developing this




## Notice


* This is my first ever mod, for anything really. It didn't have all the features I wanted on initial release but I'm really happy I could make a funny little mod. All 3D art aspects were done by me but please go show support for the original concept artist linked above as I would never have made it if I didn't stumble across their account.
